TRUCK/TAXI APP

There’s nothing better than getting access to the best possible services and enhancing the experience of your ride back home. 

Also there are lots of trucks in Nigeria waiting without jobs because clients don’t know that they are available at their disposal. 
It is also possible that the right Taxi or Truck for transportation of people and cargo is not chosen simply because clients don’t have a variety to choose from.
With services like Uber, Lyft easy Taxi and many others coming up, there are lots of options to choose from. There is also a need to develop a Truck/Taxi app for residents in Abuja and Nigeria at large.  
The Taxi/Truck booking app will use services like tracking and booking the cabs as well as mobile request acceptance features meant for drivers. It is a mean by which people choose the desires vehicle for transportation either to work, the airport, dinner outings or the movie theater
